    "The goal: write a program that determines whether what is fed to it as input is a phone number or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving, only Russian numbers were considered (possibly starting with +7, 7, 8, then, perhaps, there was a three-digit code (in brackets or not), and then a seven-digit number). It is worth noting that in order to complicate the task, it was suggested that in a seven-digit number, the numbers can be separated by a space or a dash into blocks, but two blocks of one digit cannot be adjacent, as it is unlikely that someone will write the number this way; most likely, these two blocks will merge into one, two-digit. That is, 1-23-4-56-7 is a phone number, but 1-23-4-5-67 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the problem is a regular expression. To test the program, the file 'phones.txt' was compiled, which contains test numbers (the first 20 lines are \"fake numbers\", all the rest are correct). The file 'phones_result.txt' outputs the appropriate set of lines 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the numbers are phone numbers or not."
